## About Me

Hello! I am an incoming MS & PhD integrated student at KAIST AI [Language and Knowledge Lab](https://lklab.kaist.ac.kr/). Currently, I am interested in second language adaptation of language models. More specifically, I want to convert strong language models such as LLaMa to low-resource languages.

## Research Interests

- **Multilingualism:** language adaptation, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer
- **Large Language Models:** instruction tuning, multilingual language models

## News

- **[June 2023]** I was accepted to KAIST AI MS & PhD integrated program!
