## About Me

Hello! I am an MS & PhD integrated student at KAIST [Language and Knowledge Lab](https://lklab.kaist.ac.kr/). I am interested in second language adaptation of language models. More specifically, I want to convert strong language models such as LLaMa to low-resource languages ([LangBridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10695)). I recently started a project focused on the code generation capabilities of LLMs and am eager to discuss this further. Please feel free to reach out to me!

## Research Interests

- **Multilingualism, Code Generation, Large Language Models**

- **[Mar 2024]** [LangBridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10695) was accepted to ICLR 2024 Me-FoMo workshop.
- **[June 2023]** I was accepted to KAIST MS & PhD integrated program!
- **[May 2023]** Our [Gradient Ascent Post-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07052) and [Knowledge Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01504) papers were accepted to ACL 2023 main conference.
