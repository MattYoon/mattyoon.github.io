## About Me

Hello! I am a PhD student at KAIST AI co-advised by [Alice Oh](https://aliceoh9.github.io/) and [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io/).

My research so far has focused on various topics in LLMs including multilinguality, reasoning models, and evaluation. More recently, I have been exploring speech understanding and generation, as well as text–speech foundation models (omni-models). Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss anything 🙂
