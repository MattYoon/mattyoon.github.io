## About Me

Hello! I am an MS & PhD integrated student at KAIST [Language and Knowledge Lab](https://lklab.kaist.ac.kr/). I am interested in second language adaptation of language models. More specifically, I want to convert strong language models such as LLaMa to low-resource languages ([LangBridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10695)). Please feel free to reach out to me for discussion!
