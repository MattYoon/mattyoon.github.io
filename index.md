## About Me

Hello! I am an MS & PhD integrated student at KAIST [Language and Knowledge Lab](https://lklab.kaist.ac.kr/) advised by Minjoon Seo. 

My main research focus is multilinguality. There are two reasons for this:

1. I find the idea of solving low-resource challenges through cross-lingual transfer genuinely fascinating. 
2. Many low-resource language communities are still underrepresented in AI, which I believe is an important problem to address.

Currently, I'm experimenting ideas to reduce unfairness in LLM tokenizers across languages. Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss anything.
